                  <h5>GDPR</h5>
                  <p>
                    For users in the European Union, we adhere to the Regulation
                    (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council
                    of 27 April 2016, known as the General Data Protection
                    Regulation (the "GDPR"). For users in the United Kingdom, we
                    adhere to the GDPR as enshrined in the Data Protection Act
                    2018.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We have not appointed a Data Protection Officer as we do not
                    fall within the categories of controllers and processors
                    required to appoint a Data Protection Officer under Article
                    37 of the GDPR.

                  </p>
                  <h5>Legal Basis for Processing</h5>
                  <p>
                    We collect and process personal data about users in the EU
                    only when we have a legal basis for doing so under Article 6
                    of the GDPR.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We rely on the following legal basis to collect and process
                    the personal data of users in the EU:
                  </p>
                  <p className="ms-4">
                    - Processing of user personal data is necessary for us to
                    take, at the request of a user, steps before entering a
                    contract or for the performance of a contract to which a
                    user is a party. If a user does not provide the personal
                    data necessary to perform a contract the consequences are as
                    follows: Transactions cannot take place.
                  </p>

                  <h5>How Long We Store Personal Data</h5>
                  <p>
                    User data will be stored until the purpose the data was
                    collected for has been achieved. You will be notified if
                    your data is kept for longer than this period.
                  </p>
                  <h5>How We Protect Your Personal Data</h5>
                  <p>
                    In order to protect your security, we use the strongest
                    available browser encryption and store all of our data on
                    servers in secure facilities. All data is only accessible to
                    our employees. Our employees are bound by strict
                    confidentiality agreements and a breach of this agreement
                    would result in the employee's termination.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user
                    data is secure and that users are protected, there always
                    remains the risk of harm. The Internet as a whole can be
                    insecure at times and therefore we are unable to guarantee
                    the security of user data beyond what is reasonably
                    practical.
                  </p>
